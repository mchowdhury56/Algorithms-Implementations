# Algorithms Implementations
Implementation of various algorithms in C++.

Projects I have worked on include:

gcd.cpp - Iterative and recursive implementations to find the greatest common divisor between two numbers.

student.cpp - Implementation of a student class to demonstrate object oriented programming in C++.

quickselect.cpp - Implementation of the quickselect algorithm using lomuto paritioning to find the kth smallest element in an array. The makefile should use -O3 instead of -g

sieve.cpp - Finds all the prime numbers up to k using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

unique.cpp - Uses bitwise operations to find all letters in a string are unique.

stairclimber.cpp - Uses brute force to find the number of ways to climb n stairs.

waterjugpuzzle.cpp - Solves the water jug puzzle given 3 capacities and goals using breadth-first search.

inversioncounter.cpp - Counts the number of inversions in an array by using either brute force or with mergesort.

shortestpaths.cpp - Finds all the shortest paths between points in a distance matrix using Floyd's Algorithm.
